# Poika

**Poika** is an Android app designed to help choir singers practice their voice parts independently.
With flexible audio controls, a clear interface, and easy song list management, 
it makes rehearsals more accessible and personalized.

---

## Features

- Practice **soprano** and **alto** parts separately or together
- Control volume of each track: **soprano**, **alto**, and **backing**
- Add songs by opening `.zip` files from file manager, Telegram, or email
- Delete unused songs easily via the menu

---

## How to Use

1. **Add a song to the app's songlist**  
   Open its `.zip` file outside the app via "Open with" → select **Poika**. 
   The app will import the song automatically.

2. **Start practicing**  
   Use the top-right menu to select a song.

3. **Adjust volume**  
   Use the three sliders to control the balance between voice parts and backing track.

4. **Delete a song**  
   Go to the top-right menu again and tap **Delete song**.

## Current Status & Future Plans

Currently, Poika is a tool created to support the choir in which I sing.  
All musical content (audio files, arrangements, metadata) is prepared manually,  
taking into account the repertoire and needs of the participants.

Future plans include adding tutorials and tools that will allow other users  
to create songs for Poika and use the app in their musical practice.

## Song Versions

- **Piano version**  
  Vocal parts are played by piano - great for clean pitch and rhythm.

- **Voice version**  
  Vocal parts performed by synthetic voices - better representation of note durations.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If something doesn’t work, **try restarting the app**.
- Make sure the `.zip` file follows the expected format.

## Development

This is a personal project created for a local choir community with the goals of:
- improving development skills,
- supporting musical growth,
- and contributing something meaningful.

Built with:
- Kotlin & Jetpack
- ExoPlayer for advanced media playback
- MVVM + Clean Architecture
